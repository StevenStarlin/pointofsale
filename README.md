### What is this repository for? ###
This point of sale serves as a demonstration snapshot of my current coding and architectural abilities. I chose a point of sale system because it has potential for a lot of subsystems and I have some developmental experience in this type of system from a previous project. This serves as a project to learn on, contrast against the previous project, and capture my existing design style.
